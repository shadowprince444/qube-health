Please don't get me wrong, I'll share some suggestions first, I do know I'm not an expert but you could've dynamically added the feelings icon's url from api so that we can add more feelings dynamically in the future.
The youtube links are provided in an array I hope that there will be more than one values coming up in videoArr key value so I've used pageview to switch the title and content for each video url.
Also there is no from and to time in the API were the feelings logged on a day is provided so I decided to show the logged time instead.
